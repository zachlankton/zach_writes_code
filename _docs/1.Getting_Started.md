# Getting Started!

### THIS IS A TEST TO SHOW THAT IT WORKd

Hello and welcome to this awesome web page!

Here is our very simple documentation. 
It is easy to use, easy to read, easy to print, and easy to make!

Simply create docs by placing block comments in any file anywhere followed by the word markdown
and your docs will end up indexed here!

```markdown
/⃰⃰ markdown

    # I am a doc that will show up in these docs!

⃰/
```

__By the way... don't copy that example... the asterisks are special characters so that this doc reader would ignore that block__
